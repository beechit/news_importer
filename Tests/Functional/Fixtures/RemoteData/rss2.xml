                    <description>Flea beetles have emerged from their overwintering homes in the shrubby or wooded areas surrounding fields and begun to feed on the first spring brassica plantings. This article from UMass Extension's Vegetable Notes (Vol.27 Number 6) has great information on flea beetle management.</description>

                    <description>Celery leaf curl is a relatively new disease of celery in Pennsylvania and the U.S. In an effort to learn more about the disease, we are interested in collecting as many samples as possible in 2015.</description>

                    <description>One consistent theme over the past several years has been the specter of dealing with bacterial diseases in our tomato fields and high tunnels. Bacterial speck, spot and canker have become regular challenges for Pennsylvania and Mid-Atlantic tomato growers. In spite of these challenges, it is possible to grow profitable tomato crops in this region. </description>

                    <description>These maggots attack seeds and small seedlings. While cabbage maggot and onion maggot attack only the seeds and seedlings of their namesakes, seed corn maggot will attack many plant species. Peak flight for the first generation of seed corn maggot was May 2nd in SE PA. Maggots have been confirmed in three fields in Adams, Lehigh and Lancaster Counties. Cabbage maggot is at 25% emergence and onion maggot is not out yet.</description>

                    <description>Penn State Extensionâ€™s Black Cutworm Monitoring Network has now detected six significant flights of this migratory pest species across the state. Black cutworms are a bit more active than usual this year; thus, growers generally need to be aware of this situation and watch your fields as the spring progresses.</description>

                    <description>The strawberry bloom has begun and itâ€™s time for fruit rot protection. Our two main targets for bloom time protection of strawberries are gray mold/ Botrytis fruit rot (Botrytis cinerea), and, if you are growing susceptible varieties like Chandler, anthracnose fruit rot (Colletotrichum acutatum). </description>

                    <description>Domestic honey bees hives are down by 59% compared to 60 years ago with rapid declines over the last forty years. This long term decline was punctuated by recent average losses of 30% per winter since 2006. The populations of some native bee species may also be declining. </description>

                    <description>Tomatoes can be a very challenging to grow commercially. Managing nutrients, diseases, and insect pests all contribute to this annual test of our spirits. If it was not for the high potential for profits few would grow tomatoes.</description>

                    <description>Pollinators need a diverse, abundant food source and a place to build their nests and rear their young. As land managers, if we keep these two elements in mind we can encourage native bee populations.</description>

                    <description>Backpack sprayers are very useful tools for crop farmers to have on hand. Whether your farm is large or small, newly established or centuries old, certified organic or conventional, there is a spot for a backpack sprayer or two on your farm. However, to make the most of a backpack sprayer, we recommend that you make some upgrades to the sprayer wand assembly and of course, keep your sprayer calibrated.</description>

                    <description>FARMDATA is a smartphone enabled internet-based record keeping system designed and field tested by produce farmers.  Focus areas include field and greenhouse plantings, harvest, pack, inventory, distribution, e-invoicing, labor tracking, fertilizers, compost, cover crops, tillage, irrigation, scouting, spraying, and seed orders.  The goals of FARMDATA are to replace clipboards and paper records across the produce farm, from the field to the packing house and beyond.  More importantly, FARMDATA is designed to save growers valuable time both during the busy growing season and in the winter when planning for the coming year.</description>

                    <description>Approximately three quarters of our major food crops are pollinated.  At the same time domestic honey bees hives are down by 59% compared to 60 years ago. Here we will look at how wild bees provide insurance against ongoing honey bee losses. Keep a look out for upcoming articles on factors affecting pollinators and ways farmers can promote pollinator health.</description>

                    <description>Disease management begins with the fundamental understanding of the three factors must be present and interact for disease to develop. These include: 1) a susceptible host crop; 2) the pathogen and 3) an environment that is favorable for the pathogen. This concept is called the disease triangle and all disease management practices can be related back to breaking/disrupting one or more of these interactions.</description>

                    <description>Proper calibration is a must to make sure pesticide applications get to the target at the proper rate.  The Penn State Pesticide Education Program uses calibration units that enable us to collect the output from each nozzle.  </description>

                    <description>Research was conducted to evaluate producing muskmelon  or summer squash in a strip tillage system compared to a plasticulture system. Within these production systems the effectiveness of spunbonded polypropylene row covers was also tested.</description>

                    <description>Biological control of insects, mites and diseases has the potential to greatly expand the number of effective options in our pest management toolbox. Growers now have new tools to manage insects, mites, and diseases that have become nearly impossible to control using conventional pesticides.</description>
